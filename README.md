# Crowdfund_contract
A versatile smart contract designed to manage various aspects of creating and running funding campaigns. It supports the creation of multiple campaigns, each with its own set of milestones. Milestones can be created, modified, or canceled based on contributor approval. Campaigns can be launched, suspended, and reactivated as needed. If a campaign succeeds, the creator receives the funds; otherwise, contributions are redistributed proportionally to each contributor's input. For more details, please refer to the code.
